        <p>In a significant move to accelerate vehicle modernization and reduce environmental pollution, the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has announced enhanced incentives under the Vehicle Scrappage Policy 2024.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Highlights of the New Policy:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Up to 15% rebate on road tax for commercial vehicles</li>
          <li>Up to 25% rebate on road tax for private vehicles</li>
          <li>5% discount by automobile manufacturers on purchase of new vehicle</li>
          <li>Zero registration fees for new vehicle purchase against scrapping certificate</li>
          <li>Income tax benefits for individuals and businesses</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The policy aims to phase out unfit and polluting vehicles while stimulating demand in the auto sector. Vehicle owners will receive a scrapping certificate upon disposal of their old vehicles, which can be used to avail these benefits.</p>
        
        <p>"This policy will help reduce pollution, improve road and passenger safety, formalize the informal vehicle scrapping industry, and recover low-cost materials for the automotive, steel and electronics industry," said the Transport Minister during the announcement.</p>

        <h4>Program Highlights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimum guaranteed valuation 30% above standard scrap rates</li>
          <li>Additional 5% discount on new vehicle purchases</li>
          <li>Acceptance of vehicles in any condition â€“ running or non-running</li>
          <li>Free towing services from any location</li>
          <li>Simplified paperwork with single-window processing</li>
          <li>Valid for both private and commercial vehicles</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The program represents a significant shift in manufacturer approach to vehicle exchange, with participating companies establishing direct partnerships with authorized RVSFs rather than relying on third-party intermediaries.</p>
        
        <p>"This industry-led initiative aims to accelerate the retirement of older vehicles while providing tangible economic benefits to consumers," said Vikram Singh, President of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. "By offering premium value regardless of vehicle condition, we're removing a major barrier to scrapping decisions."</p>
        
        <p>Participating manufacturers include Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Mahindra, Kia, and Honda. The program will be operational across all authorized dealerships starting May 1, 2024, and is scheduled to run for a minimum of 12 months.</p>
